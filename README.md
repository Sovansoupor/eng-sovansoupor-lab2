# Getting started

This repository is a sample application for users following the getting started guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.

The application is based on the application from the getting started tutorial at https://github.com/docker/getting-started

# Reflection of the lesson

- First, I learned how to containerize an application by creating a Dockerfile, building an image, and running it as a container.
- Then, I understood how to update an application by modifying the source code, rebuilding the image, and replacing the old container with the new version.
- I gained experience sharing Docker images through Docker Hub by creating a repository, pushing my images, and pulling them from another environment.
- Moreover, I explored data persistence using Docker volumes to keep application data intact even after containers are removed.
- I learned how bind mounts allow local files to sync with a running container for real-time development.
- I understood multi-container concepts and how a custom Docker network enables communication between services like an application and a database.
- Furthermore, I learned how Docker Compose simplifies multi-container applications by defining all services in a single configuration file.
- Finally, I studied image-building best practices, including understanding layers, cached builds, and using multi-stage builds for smaller and optimized production images.
